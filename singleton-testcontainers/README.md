## WHAT IS IT?

We all do unit/integration tests. 

Sometimes we find yourself in need of running a single instance of whatever we need inside a container from within our test classes.[ Postgresql, elasticsearch, selenium browsers..].

Or perhaps bootstrap our own application, scaling it up during a jenkins job then gracefully shutting it down?

Parallel Testing? 

Using a real database instead of an H2? 

The are multiple use cases. In this project i decided to use docker for functional tests with selenium. A complete sandboxed, portable & production grade environment.
